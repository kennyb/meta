Intro
=====

when I was 16 years old, I had a brain hemorrhage. this paralyzed me entirely on the left-side of my body. the bleed happened in the right hemisphere, in the part of my brain which is called the "pre-motor strip". this is the part of the brain which creates the desire to want to move. learning about my paralysis taught me a lot about my brain. over time, the more I explored my brain, the more I learned about it. this is my attempt to explain it to you :)


The Damage
==========

(neurosurgeons, correct me if I'm wrong)
so, a person with damage in this area will just stay doing what he/she is doing forever... that is, until someone motivates them to do something different.. and then the body can move. essentially, with time, I found out that my goal was to learn how to overcome my fear of looking like an idiot when I walk, and create the desire to want to walk correctly.

The Learning Process
====================

I don't use any technology to discover my own brain. most of the time, it was discovered thinking to myself over a coffee and a cigarette. at first I had a heavy addiction to drinking. this appeared normal and under control, but it really wasn't, because I mostly drank by myself. however, I found out that when my mind was loosened up a bit, I was able to reach deeper into my own mind. so, often times, I would go to a bar in madrid, order a jack daniels, pull out my pen and write everything that came to my mind on napkins... I tried to determine my desire for doing certain things.

during this process, I discovered a lot of things that I didn't like about myself. you could say that there were a lot of things that didn't make sense why I did them... they were just pre-programmed responses. I started separating my pre-programmed responses, and my desire while drunk. the next day I would review my notes and learn from myself (cause usually I wouldn't remember what I had found out about myself)

The Right Brain
===============

I found out much later, that what I was doing, was communicating with my right-brain. the right brain is interesting because it's very abstract and creative. you could say it's a collection of concepts... or the person's programming. I found out that the right-brain doesn't have voice, only emotions and abstract ideas - which is why I needed to write them down and learn from myself. I began syncing my hemispheres.

the right brain is very childlike, playful, doesn't really care about forms (color, race, gender, etc.) and it's also very receptive.

The Cigarette
=============

during the time I was discovering this about myself, I was addicted to cigarettes. so, one of the things I did, was to discover the process in which I smoke a cigarette. this began to teach me about the different stages of my mind in the active process of turning desire into 3D.

first I noticed I had a desire to smoke a cigarette. whether this was induced chemically, or whatever, it didn't matter, because the reason for this desire was determined by my logic. eg. "I am stressed right now and need to smoke a cigarette", or, "I will quit tomorrow, so this will be the last one", etc.

so, mixing desire and logic, I was motivated to smoke a cigarette. next, I need another mix to make reality. I needed a collection of abstract concepts to figure out how to perform this.

so, I would think to myself, ok in spain, you can't smoke in bars, so I will have to go outside. I don't have cigarettes, so I will need to buy some in the machine, etc. rapidly, in microseconds my brain would construct the entire form in which I could do this in my current time in 3D. so, mixing my current reality, and my abstract concepts of that reality, I would create imaginations. I would picture myself walking outside and smoking that cigarette, and feeling the pleasure. my imagination motivated me in the 3D realm.

so, I would mix desire and logic to create the motivator. next I would mix my current abstract concept of the world and my current position in 3D to make an imagination of this process.

Reality Science
===============

at first, I called it "figuring out why" - then I called it "figuring out reality" - however, now I call it "reality science". the obvious reason for this is because reality is a science. one branch branch of our research (abstract concept) is called "science" - this science tries to discover how our world works by looking at the details. so, I began to look at the details of reality.

I started paying attention to small things in the universe. if you're autistic, then this should be normal to you. anyway, I took the science from a different perspective. instead of using my imagination to make a hypothesis, I would just study the reality until I started seeing connections. this form of discovery sometimes is looked down upon because it doesn't produce the expected result, but it's how charles darwin discovered evolution. additionally, I think most influential inventors discovered their inventions by accident, or by studying the world. I determined this would be my plan

Learning About Time
===================

when I would talk to someone, I started noticing that we normally communicate on 3 essential levels. this was in 3D with voice, body language, and image. next up, one can create an imagination in someone else's mind. this imagination is very influential and can modify one's behavior.

I used to be a very imaginary person, but when my brain thing happened, I lost a lot of my visual memory, because right next-door is the short term memory part of the brain. anyway, imagination has always been somewhat of a mystery to me, not even able to remember the face of someone I have met. I would recognize people by their motion, body language, voice, and general feel. I found out this to be mostly the abstract world.

now, I needed to separate these worlds. I found out they were separated by time. so, 3D is NOW... there's no other instantiation of 3D other than right now. if I were to perceive 3D that wasn't now, I would use my imagination. so, I am typing on a computer right now. a macbook pro 15". the screen is dirty and I have to look around the blotches on the screen because it's a sunny day in berlin and there's a lot of light in the room.

having told you that, you probably generated an imaginary picture of me on my computer right now. perhaps you can see it from multiple angles and stuff. perhaps you can even imagine me typing. the point is, that the imagination realm is composed of potential past and future events. the imaginary world is only composed of past and future possibilities though. I cannot imagine something that I have never seen before.

so, the abstract realm is composed of concepts that you know about and ones that you don't know about. these exist in always and never. something is always true or never true. you can be in a concept or out of a concept. because the abstract world is mostly emotion, concept, and symbol, it became easy to recognize what a person is really trying to tell me.

What a person is REALLY saying...
=================================

so, imagine a person comes up to you and they start bitching about how real madrid lost to bar√ßa, yet again... this is an abstract concept. however, this is an instantiation of anger. so, when I listen to a person speak, I can determine what they are really trying to say, by moving up the levels of the abstract idea. what this person is really telling me is perhaps that his marriage is shit, his wife hates him, and his kids are totally out of control. he is probably drawing connections between the last game and his situation. if there are similar concepts, that person will collect the anger of that moment.

What the Abstract World Looks Like
==================================

first, it doesn't look like anything. don't imagine it. it has very little form, and that form you will discover yourself, because there is no imagination I can give you to describe it. I can only tell you where it is. so, to paint a picture of how it works, so you can recognize it, lemme tell a story:

so, we're back in the bar and this time, I'm talking to a girl. this girl has an abstract concept of herself. she has an image of herself. these images include concepts. some girls believe they are ugly and guys won't like them. other girls will believe that because they are so hot, no guy can possibly resist her. they can be seen. in the lower levels of the abstract world, there are things like recognizing body language and tone of the voice. to determine the abstract ideas of this person (if they're angry, or sad or whatever). each concept has a vibrational level which corresponds to the upper mix, but we'll come back to that.

so, I walk in and I'm talking to this girl. I'm getting into her concepts of reality, and we're beginning to meet in the imagination world. I use 3d (my voice, body language, etc.) to convince her that I'm entering her concept. now, all of a sudden 5 of her friends enter the bar. they're PISSED. something just happened, and they are very angry.

so, it looks like this... this girl and I are at a higher vibratory level, talking about nice things, and learning about each other's interpretations of the same concept, when these girls are at a very low vibrational level with a lot of intensity. when people join together, the people's concepts attempt to meet. they attract each other. they are receptive. so, our concepts will meet in a middle point, so now one of two things will happen. our vibration at on a higher level will attract them to join us up there, and they will lose their angry and join us in the conversation, laugh and have fun... I notice a small "intimacy loss" though, but it's ok. the other possibility is that they drag us down to their level and we join them in their anger and frustration. the last is they find the concepts incompatible and leave.

I noticed this everywhere. a sad person will make everyone sad around, and will want everyone to be sad around them. "misery loves company" (but then, so does happiness). time, in the abstract realm, time does not exist. it is a product of the infinite concepts which I "wear" or "express"

Beyond the Abstract
===================

so, skipping over a lot of things, I got stuck on the abstract realm quite a while. the last abstract concept there was, would feel like a bridge over fire. I didn't know how to cross over the fire. after a while, I decided to just cross it and find out what's on the other side. this is when I learned about the upper mix of desire, motivation, and logic. let's just cross over there now, before I describe the fire realm (where everything is equal, but separated, with only polarities of positive and negative).

The Upper Sections of my brain
==============================
[TODO]

The Project
===========

I will provide a visual reference of how my brain works. some of it will be very detailed and some of it will be extreme. this is meant to be an open-collective consciousness project where everyone can contribute. the reason is because we all basically have the same hardware (neurons, etc.) but we're not aware of how our operating system works. I found a lot of correlations between the universe and my brain. I also found out a lot of other people think very similarly (NOT THE SAME), so I thought maybe it would be helpful to create a visual demonstration of what happens. most people don't naturally have the feedback from their own brain like I got, cause of the brain hemorrhage.
